TEST SCENARIOS SUMMARY
======================
This document summarizes all test cases covered in the tracer-sentinel system.

PASSING TEST CASES (2)
----------------------

1. pass_points_match_inside_workarea
   Description: All expected points match actual points and are located inside the work area
   Input: Rectangle with 4 coordinates, 6 points all inside the rectangle
   Expected: All points should be detected correctly within the work area boundaries
   Status: PASS

2. pass_points_match_on_boundary
   Description: Points match and some are located on the boundary of the work area
   Input: Rectangle with 4 coordinates (with extra whitespace), 8 points on edges/corners
   Expected: Boundary points should be correctly detected and validated
   Status: PASS


FAILING TEST CASES - INPUT VALIDATION (9)
------------------------------------------

3. fail_incomplete_workarea
   Description: Rectangle definition is incomplete (missing coordinates)
   Input: Only 1 coordinate provided for rectangle instead of 4
   Expected: System should fail validation due to incomplete work area definition
   Status: FAIL

4. fail_invalid_coordinates_actual
   Description: Actual points output file contains invalid coordinate format
   Input: Valid rectangle and expected points, invalid format in actual output
   Expected: System should fail validation due to malformed coordinates
   Status: FAIL

5. fail_invalid_coordinates_expected
   Description: Expected points contain invalid coordinate format
   Input: Valid rectangle, expected points with malformed coordinate (missing comma)
   Example: (1.9 8.41) instead of (1.9, 8.41)
   Expected: System should fail validation due to malformed expected coordinates
   Status: FAIL

6. fail_invalid_coordinates_rectangle
   Description: Rectangle coordinates are malformed
   Input: Rectangle coordinate with incomplete format
   Example: (0.79, 2.51 instead of (0.79, 2.51)
   Expected: System should fail validation due to invalid rectangle definition
   Status: FAIL

7. fail_invalid_keyword_points
   Description: "Points:" keyword is misspelled
   Input: "Puints:" instead of "Points:"
   Expected: System should fail to parse due to incorrect keyword
   Status: FAIL

8. fail_invalid_keyword_rectangle
   Description: "Rectangle:" keyword is misspelled
   Input: "Rectangol:" instead of "Rectangle:"
   Expected: System should fail to parse due to incorrect keyword
   Status: FAIL

9. fail_missing_keyword_points
   Description: "Points:" keyword is completely missing from input
   Input: Rectangle definition followed directly by coordinates without "Points:" label
   Expected: System should fail to parse due to missing section keyword
   Status: FAIL

10. fail_missing_keyword_rectangle
    Description: "Rectangle:" keyword is completely missing from input
    Input: Coordinates listed without "Rectangle:" label
    Expected: System should fail to parse due to missing section keyword
    Status: FAIL

11. fail_no_point_rectangle
    Description: No rectangle coordinates provided after "Rectangle:" keyword
    Input: "Rectangle:" followed immediately by "Points:" section
    Expected: System should fail validation due to empty rectangle definition
    Status: FAIL


FAILING TEST CASES - DATA VALIDATION (4)
-----------------------------------------

12. fail_no_point_expected
    Description: No expected points provided in input file
    Input: Valid rectangle but empty "Points:" section
    Expected: System should fail validation due to missing expected points
    Status: FAIL

13. fail_no_points_actual
    Description: Actual output file contains valid expected points but test compares against missing actual data
    Input: Valid rectangle and expected points
    Expected: System should fail when no actual output points are available for comparison
    Status: FAIL

14. fail_more_actual_than_expected
    Description: System detected more points than expected
    Input: 6 expected points, 8 actual points detected
    Expected: System should fail due to count mismatch (extra points detected)
    Status: FAIL

15. fail_more_expected_than_actual
    Description: System detected fewer points than expected
    Input: 8 expected points, 6 actual points detected
    Expected: System should fail due to count mismatch (missing points)
    Status: FAIL


FAILING TEST CASES - POINT MATCHING (2)
----------------------------------------

16. fail_points_mismatch_actual_inside_workarea
    Description: Actual points are inside work area but don't match expected coordinates
    Input: 6 expected points, 6 actual points with different coordinates (all inside)
    Expected: System should fail due to coordinate mismatch despite correct count
    Status: FAIL

17. fail_points_mismatch_actual_outside_workarea
    Description: Actual points are outside the work area boundaries
    Input: 6 expected points inside work area, 6 actual points with coordinates outside
    Expected: System should fail due to points being outside work area and not matching expected
    Status: FAIL

TEST COVERAGE AREAS
-------------------
✓ Valid input with points inside work area
✓ Valid input with points on boundary
✓ Incomplete rectangle definition
✓ Invalid coordinate formats (rectangle, expected points, actual points)
✓ Misspelled keywords (Rectangle, Points)
✓ Missing keywords (Rectangle, Points)
✓ Empty rectangle definition
✓ Empty expected points
✓ Missing actual points
✓ Count mismatches (more/fewer actual than expected)
✓ Coordinate mismatches (inside work area)
✓ Coordinates outside work area

NOTES
-----
- The system validates input format, coordinate syntax, and keyword presence
- Work area is defined by a rectangle with 4 corner coordinates
- Points must match exactly in both count and sequence
- Boundary points are considered valid (inclusive boundaries)
- The system performs comprehensive validation before point comparison
